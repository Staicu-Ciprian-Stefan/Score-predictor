Program to predict score in football tournaments.

Code for neural network inspired by:

Problem is too little data for accurate prediction.
Predicted values for extra halves and penalties mess up the overall accuracy.

To do:
- Generalize for both input types
- Visual interface ?
- Different accuracy computation in case there arenâ€™t penalties or extra halves
- Add output of predicted vs real score, for all matches and metrics to keep track of where is the smallest accuracy.
  To check if there are any observable bottlenecks.
